        Hi, there. I'm Eoma and I'm here to help you decide what to eat. My
        philosophy of choosing what to eat depends on what I will be doing after
        I eat. For example, if I have a session of productivity planned right
        after eating, I will suggest that you eat something light and healthy so
        you don't feel tired and lazy from a big, fatty meal. <br></br>So, let
        me know what you got planned for today!
